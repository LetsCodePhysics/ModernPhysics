    "This program, based on [this exmaple](https://scipython.com/book/chapter-8-scipy/examples/visualizing-the-spherical-harmonics/), uses the SciPy library to generate a visualization of the **spherical harmonics** $Y_{l}^{m}(\\theta,\\phi)$. Spherical harmonics are three-dimensional versions of the sine and cosine function. Sine and cosine are, at their core, defined by a differential equation\n",

The visualization uses color to represent the value of $\\left|Y_{l}^{m}(\\theta,\\phi)\\right|$ (where red indicates a higher value and blue a lower value), whereas most plots represent it dumbell-style (where the distance from the origin indicates the value)."
