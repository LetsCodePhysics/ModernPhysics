    "##### CODE\n",
    "Since we'll be using the Rydberg formula repeatedly, it's helpful to **define a function** to carry out this calculation for us. Python allows you to define your own function as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "``def fun(var1, var2, ...):\n",
    "    calculations\n",
    "    return value``\n",
    "\n",
    "``fun`` is the name of the function. You should always pick a function name that makes sense to you. We'll call this function ``wavelength`` since that's what we're interested in calculating.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``var1, var2, ...`` contains **any number of input variables** that you want. If you're defining a simple function like $f(x) = x^2$, you just need one input variable ``x``. For the Rydberg formula, we need two inputs: ``n`` and ``k``.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``calculations`` section contains all the lines of code necessary to carry out the function. Notice that this section is *indented* just like a loop, to indicate that the lines of code fall under the function. You can do anything in these calculations that you can normally in Python. You can loop, print values, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the ``return`` statement presents the calculated value that you want the function to return. The ``value`` after ``return`` can be a single variable or a calculation. For example, to set up a function for $f(x) = x^2$, either\n",
    "\n",
    "``def square(x):\n",
    "    f = x**2\n",
    "    return f``\n",

    "\n",
    "``def square(x):\n",
    "    return x**2``\n",
    "  \n",
    "will produce the same result.\n",
    "\n",

For example, let's suppose we want to know whether the temperature outside is comfortable, defined as a temperature between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
